title: Real Analysis Notes
permalink: /analysis/
---

Here are my notes for real analysis based on Chapters 1 to 7 of Rudin's _Principles of Mathematical Analysis_. In addition to the standard definitions, theorems, and proofs, I have provided my own commentary to motivate the ideas of real analysis. I have also included interesting exercises to train the reader's intuition and proof technique, and to expand on the main text.

Prerequisites: first-year calculus, linear algebra, and an "introduction to proof" course.
