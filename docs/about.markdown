I used to think of math as a collection of "rules" to memorize -- the more rules I could memorize, the better I was at math. For example, I memorized that a negative number times a negative number equals a positive number. Later, I memorized the Pythagorean Theorem, the sine and cosine laws, various derivatives and integrals, and so on. I took these rules for granted and never thought too hard about why these rules existed.

When I got to university, I took a class on writing mathematical proofs. I learned that most of the rules I memorized were just logical consequences of a few basic axioms. After learning about proofs, my view of math changed completely. I did not need to memorize any more rules; I could just prove them and even discover them by myself. This is part of the journey that practically every math student progresses through -- see this [blog post](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/) from the famous mathematician Terence Tao.

I think it would be fun to try making rigorous sense of the rules and algorithms I had memorized in my _pre-rigorous_ phase. That's what this blog is primarily about.

<b>A quick browser test:</b>

To verify that math text loads correctly, you should see a statement of the Mean Value Theorem below.

<b>Theorem (MVT).</b> Let $a < b$ be real numbers. Suppose $f: [a, b]\to\mathbb{R}$ is
continuous on $[a, b]$ and differentiable on $(a, b)$. Then there exists $c\in (a, b)$
such that
<div>
    \[\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} = f'(c).\]
</div>
