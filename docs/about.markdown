I graduated from UBC with a math (and computer science) degree in 2024. While I've ultimately chosen to pursue software development as a career, I still enjoy doing math for fun. This blog is where I write about math.

<b>A quick browser test:</b>

To verify that math text loads correctly, you should see a statement of the Mean Value Theorem below.

<b>Theorem (MVT).</b> Let $a < b$ be real numbers. Suppose $f: [a, b]\to\mathbb{R}$ is
continuous on $[a, b]$ and differentiable on $(a, b)$. Then there exists $c\in (a, b)$
such that
<div>
    \[\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} = f'(c).\]
</div>
